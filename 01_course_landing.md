					<h3>Gi-Modules</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				GI Modules is a blog-based collection of learning content in the broad field of geoinformatics. The blogs are sorted by categories and tags. Under the categories, related content is grouped together. Within the content pages, you can navigate to related articles via the tags.
The contents are therefore thematically associated but not intended as a closed workflow. The course units are composed of individual modules.

					<h3>Basic geoinformatics course(QGIS)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>

Spatio-temporal data and their manipulation, analysis and representation are basic scientific elements of geography. The analyses form the basis for gaining knowledge in research and the resulting media are the central means of communication. Data and data analysis, as well as the modeling of these data, are therefore an integral part of professional understanding. The basal handling of data, preparation, visual exploration, analysis, and presentation represents an important core competency for a geographer's job description. This course is the basic GIS course for geographers.

				The course Micro Remote Sensing - provides a complete introduction to the reproducible acquisition preprocessing and examplary analysis of high resolution imaging threat data based on open source software.
This course is designed for students of all levels who have a basic knowledge of the organization of their operating system. Programming knowledge is not required but will be helpful for the advanced module Analysis of high resolution aerial data. The focus is on a practical approach to the independent acquisition of high resolution aerial data. Post-processing of products and an introduction to classification and analysis of the generated datasets complete the course.

					<h3>Big Data and Spatial Econometrics </h3>
				</header>
				<p>

				Spatio-temporal data analysis, especially of Big Data, and spatio-temporal prediction on these data are typical requirements of spatial econometrics. The adequate analysis of spatial data and the reliable assessment of spatial correlations are the basis for many economic decision-making processes. For communication purposes, suitable visualizations and geomedia must be created. The basic handling of data, preparation, visual exploration, analysis and presentation are taught in this course as an important core competence for spatial economic and social processes.

					<h3>System Dynamics - an introduction
Simulation of dynamic processes </h3>
				</header>
				<p>

				The understanding of spatio-temporal processes, the delineation and modeling of appropriate systems, and the simulation of specific system dynamics are of increasing importance in society and science. Geography, as an interdisciplinary field of science, plays an important role here. Analyses carried out on the basis of models form the basis for gaining knowledge in research. The resulting media and their interpretation are furthermore central means of communication in research but also for decision makers and the formation of social opinion.

					<h3>GeoAI - use AI to predict spatial patterns</h3>
				</header>
				<p>

				Understanding environmental change and assessing consequences requires spatial information from landscapes. The crucial question is not whether a landscape contains forest, meadow, field, and river, but how they relate to each other spatially. When collecting spatial information in the field, a tradeoff must be made between level of detail, scale, and temporal repetition. Selected processes can either be studied in detail at a very limited number of observation sites or estimated at a generalized scale for a landscape. The constraints loosen when linking local surveys with area-wide remote sensing observations and predicting the locally collected information in space with artificial intelligence methods.

					<h3>Environmental Systems - Microclimate Modeling using ENVI-met </h3>
				</header>
				<p>

				Forest ecosystems have highly variable microclimates that are also significantly different from the surrounding climate. In the forest, direct solar radiation and wind speed are greatly reduced leading to the attenuation of extreme climates. The magnitude and more so the processes of these differences especially in a highly structured and relief forest is significant. This course will attempt to predict the spatiotemporal high-resolution heterogeneity of microclimates using the modeling software ENVI-met.

					<h3>Media Competence Environmental Informatics</h3>

				<p>

Media and models are basic scientific elements of geography. They form the basis for gaining knowledge in research and serve as a means of communication. Media and models are thus primarily not a pedagogical element, but an integral part of a professional examination of a topic.

					<h3> Extracurricular learning locations (Ausserschulische Lernorte AsLo)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
Extracurricular learning locations allow the direct processing of geographical subject matter in real space. In this module, you will develop learning locations that are resilient, adaptive, vulnerable or mal-adaptive in terms of climate change education and work out what this means for the space. Based on the thematic development, you will carry out a methodical elaboration so that you can transfer the content into a 60-minute excursion and achieve knowledge transfer and awareness-raising for the local conditions.

<h4>GIS Modules Bachelor 2010/2011</h4>

Since they are still in demand they are linked here: GISMA's first two German-language GIS learning modules based on learning theory. 

At that time, the online learning materials were intended to provide a clearly structured knowledge base that was aligned with the course objectives and that demanded and supported self-directed learning.
The online offering was based on a constructivist understanding of didactics in terms of learning theory.
All courses were structured as blended learning modules, i.e., they included attendance phases and self-directed learning times. However, the courses are also suitable for independent study of the subject matter. All courses are available as SCORM/IMS modules for any learning platform. 

Attention due to the over 10 years old technology, there may be errors in the presentation.
