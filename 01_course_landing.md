					<h3>Gi-Modules</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				GI Modules is a blog-based collection of learning content in the broad field of geoinformatics. The blogs are sorted by categories and tags. Under the categories, related content is grouped together. Within the content pages, you can navigate to related articles via the tags.
The contents are therefore thematically associated but not intended as a closed workflow. The course units are composed of individual modules.

					<h3>Basic geoinformatics course(QGIS)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				<p class="notice--warning">German Only</p>
Spatio-temporal data and their manipulation, analysis and representation are basic scientific elements of geography. The analyses form the basis for gaining knowledge in research and the resulting media are the central means of communication. Data and data analysis, as well as the modeling of these data, are therefore an integral part of professional understanding. The basal handling of data, preparation, visual exploration, analysis, and presentation represents an important core competency for a geographer's job description. This course is the basic GIS course for geographers.

					<h3>Micro Remote Sensing </h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				The course Micro Remote Sensing - provides a complete introduction to the reproducible acquisition preprocessing and examplary analysis of high resolution imaging threat data based on open source software.
This course is designed for students of all levels who have a basic knowledge of the organization of their operating system. Programming knowledge is not required but will be helpful for the advanced module Analysis of high resolution aerial data. The focus is on a practical approach to the independent acquisition of high resolution aerial data. Post-processing of products and an introduction to classification and analysis of the generated datasets complete the course.

					<h3>LV-19-d19-006 - Advanced GIS (Micro Climate Modeling)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				The advanced Geoinformation Systems (aGIS) course is a full term overview of selected methodological approaches in advanced GIS analysis using reproducible research workflows, based on R and Open Source Software and a full integration of GitHub. This course is intended for the master level in Geography to participants who have a working knowledge of the basic organisation of their operating system as well as basic knowledge of GI Concepts and Scripting. The scientific topic is statistical modeling of forest microclimate based on LiDAR and sentinel datasets and station measurements.

					<h3>Big Data and Spatial Econometrics </h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				<p class="notice--warning">German Only</p>
				Spatio-temporal data analysis, especially of Big Data, and spatio-temporal prediction on these data are typical requirements of spatial econometrics. The adequate analysis of spatial data and the reliable assessment of spatial correlations are the basis for many economic decision-making processes. For communication purposes, suitable visualizations and geomedia must be created. The basic handling of data, preparation, visual exploration, analysis and presentation are taught in this course as an important core competence for spatial economic and social processes.

<h4>GIS Modules Bachelor 2010/2011</h4>

<p class="notice--warning">German Only</p>


Since they are still in demand they are linked here: GISMA's first two German-language GIS learning modules based on learning theory. 

At that time, the online learning materials were intended to provide a clearly structured knowledge base that was aligned with the course objectives and that demanded and supported self-directed learning.
The online offering was based on a constructivist understanding of didactics in terms of learning theory.
All courses were structured as blended learning modules, i.e., they included attendance phases and self-directed learning times. However, the courses are also suitable for independent study of the subject matter. All courses are available as SCORM/IMS modules for any learning platform. 

Attention due to the over 10 years old technology, there may be errors in the presentation.
