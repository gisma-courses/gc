Student workload, fit, teaching capacity, modularisation, the cumulative examination system, contact time, consecutive study programmes, the credit point system, transcripts of records, learning outcomes, credit transfer procedures, ECTS, employability, competence transfer - all of these not only smell like, but also mean standardisation, bureaucratisation and, above all, economisation of university teaching and learning.

But there are also opportunities and room for manoeuvre if they are actively used. The Bologna Process places the needs of students more firmly in the foreground. Ultimately, economised university education has to strike a balance between vocational training and academic specialisation. The much-quoted and little-understood concept of competency-centred modular teaching and learning offers the leeway not to lose sight of the Humboldtian ideal of education and yet to do justice to the need for practice-oriented, application-oriented and scientifically justified education.

# Development of competences

Against the background of competence-oriented education, it is not easy to formulate teaching and learning objectives in a catchy way. However, the following are perhaps the most important aspects:

* Learning defined subject-specific skills and abilities as a basis for any goal-oriented action.
* The integration of specific didactic methods for knowledge acquisition on the assumption that learning is an active, self-directed, constructive, situational and social process.
* Teaching analytical, solution-oriented thinking and action in order to develop intuitive and creative problem-solving strategies.
* Encouraging autonomous personal development, particularly with regard to the development of personal and social skills. 
social-communicative competence

# Problems versus solutions

In recent decades there has been a shift in pedagogy and didactics from the object of learning to the subject of learning. Learners are no longer seen as passive or active recipients, but as active constructors, accompanied by crises. An authentic problem orientation plays a crucial role in a successful learning environment. In the best case, teaching focuses on questions that are meaningful to the learners, that make them curious and/or concerned.

A good implementation in university teaching, for example, is based on the teaching concept of problem-based learning.

Learning is student-centred and takes place in small groups.
A tutor monitors and supports the learning process
Problems form the starting point and stimulus for the learning process; the learner uses them to acquire knowledge.
the learner acquires the necessary problem-solving skills
Learners acquire new information through self-directed learning.

The directed transfer of knowledge is now only one aspect of higher education. Instead, students are guided and supported in their active, independent exploration of issues.

Teaching in the GI-S area is developed and implemented on this basis. More on this topic can be found in the following literature.

# Learning content

The aim of the learning and teaching modules linked here is to provide geographers and other interested parties with access to contemporary methods of spatio-temporal description, analysis and interpretation of the world.  The last decade has seen a rapid evolution in which, alongside AI methods and big data, complex physical models and the integration of complex spatio-temporal analysis have increasingly become state of the art. The road ahead is challenging. The course offerings linked on these pages are guided by the following guiding questions:

* How can media and geo-information methods and techniques be integrated into geographic education and scientific application in a professionally appropriate way?

* How can I acquire sovereign competences in the field of spatio-temporal abstraction and modelling?

The didactic design of the different modules is generally based on constructivist learning theory. In contrast to the schooling of the university system resulting from the Bologna process, the courses offered here require a high degree of self-organised and self-motivated learning.
In general, no distinction is made between Master's and Bachelor's programmes. Both courses are based on a strict orientation towards scientific reproducibility and transparency at the most up-to-date methodological level. As far as possible, the learning of methods and modelling skills in geography is project-based. The learning materials provided here serve as a basis for classroom teaching, blended learning approaches and self-study. 

# My self-perception as a teacher

My self-image as a science teacher is that of a coach. I cannot climb a mountain or run a marathon for you. You can only do that yourself and train for it. In this way, I can offer my experience and perspective as a coach, advisor and constructive critic. But as a climber you have to climb yourself, you know that and you just have to do it. 
If this course is to be useful, you will need to reflect critically on what I bring to it, what you learn in discussions with your colleagues, what you read and what you think you have safely learned.  Only then is development possible, and development is the goal of all education. This cannot be said often enough: Education depends to a large extent on what you put into it. So if you're not doing much more than just being there, you can assume that it's a waste of time for you. Science is about progress based on the work of countless others, it is about _standing on the shoulders of giants_[¹] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). If you want to take part, you have to climb up there: So get started, think, reflect and discuss, stumble into dead ends, start again, gather and compare experiences, develop your own way of working and building knowledge.
