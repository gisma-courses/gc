					<h3>Teaching backgrounds</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				In recent decades there has been a shift in pedagogy from the object of learning to the subject of learning. Learners are no longer seen as passive or active recipients, but as active constructors, accompanied by crises. An authentic problem orientation plays a crucial role in a successful learning environment. In the best case, teaching focuses on questions that are meaningful to the learners, that make them curious and/or concerned.

					<h3>Theses & Evaluation</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				The most important basis is commitment and enjoyment of the (self-imposed) task. You should also be prepared to write an exposé at the beginning of your work, which will serve as a basis for supervision and as an outline for the final project. You can be sure that you will be supervised with the same commitment that you put into your own work.
